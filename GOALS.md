For our project, we plan to use the OpenFlights data set. Specifically, we will use the data set of airports only, not including train stations and ferry terminals. The data set includes data from airports, airlines, and routes all over the world.

Using this data set, we will use a shortest path algorithm to create a program that finds the best route between destinations. We can use the airports.dat file to associate airport codes with geographical locations and use that to determine route distances, which will serve as the weights for the shortest path algorithm.

We will also use a page rank algorithm to gauge the popularity of various airports based on the routes. We will use Breadth First Search to traverse through our graph. Depending on what libraries are available, we will use a linear algebra library to determine the rank of a matrix. We plan on using Graphviz to generate visualizations of the PageRank algorithm or shortest paths between various airports. We will also write tests for each of our algorithms using appropriate test cases. Our code will be written so that it is able to build and run on EWS using just what is in our repository.
